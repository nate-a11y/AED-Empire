AEDs are designed for use by anyone—no medical background required. The device provides voice prompts and visual instructions to guide you through each step.</p>"

AEDs are designed for immediate use by bystanders with no medical experience—the device walks you through every step with clear audio and visual prompts. That said, CPR/AED certification courses (typically 2-4 hours) build confidence and improve response time in emergencies. We recommend training but it's not a barrier to saving a life.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>AED warranties vary by manufacturer, typically ranging from 5–8 years for devices. Brands like HeartSine and Philips often offer 8-year coverage, while others vary by model. Pads and batteries carry separate warranties (usually 2–5 years). We honor all manufacturer warranties and handle the coordination for you if any issues arise.</p>"
